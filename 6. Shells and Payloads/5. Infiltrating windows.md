## Enumerating Windows & Fingerprinting Methods

>How do we identify if a host is windows or linux?????
>Answer : when using ICMP (Ping request) to check if a host is up, if it's windows, typically the TTL value will be 32 or 128.

- We can use multiple types paylods for windows hosts.. DLLs, batch files, msi packages and even powershell scripts
- All of these file types are executable in windows.

#### DLL
- Dynamic Link Library
- library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once.
#### Batch
- DOS scripts utilized by the system admins to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter.
- .bat extension
#### VBS
- light weight scripting language based on microsoft's visual basic.
#### MSI

- serve as installation database for windows installer.
- once we have it in the host, we can run `msiexec` to execute the file.

#### Powershell
- both a shell environment and scripting language.

| `MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework` | [Source](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. It serves as a way to enumerate hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, and perform post-exploitation actions once on the host. Think of it as a swiss-army knife. |

#### Payload Transfer and Execution:

Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.

- `Impacket`: [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a toolset built in Python that provides us with a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with `psexec`, `smbclient`, `wmi`, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.
- [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md): is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.
- `SMB`: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.
- `Remote execution via MSF`: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.
- `Other Protocols`: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.
