For one last quick example of this naming convention, consider these two : 

`windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` and `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`. 

The former is a `Staged` payload. Notice the naming convention separating the stages. The latter is a `Stageless` payload since we see the shell payload and network communication in the same portion of the name.
