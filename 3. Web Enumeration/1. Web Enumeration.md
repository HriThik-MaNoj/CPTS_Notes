### Directory/File Enumeration

#### Gobuster

- `GoBuster` is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets.

**Syntax :** 
```shell-session
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```


#### Banner Grabbing / Web Server Headers

- Similar to what we did in [[2. Attacking Network Services]]
- We can use `cURL` to retrieve server header information from the command line
**Syntax :** 
```shell-session
curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com
```

#### Whatweb

- We can extract the version of web servers, supporting frameworks, and applications using the command-line tool `whatweb`
**Syntax :** 
```shell-session
whatweb 10.10.10.121
```

#### Certificates

- SSL/TLS certificates are another potentially valuable source of information if HTTPS is in use. Browsing to `https://10.10.10.121/` and viewing the certificate reveals the details including the email address and company name. These could potentially be used to conduct a phishing attack if this is within the scope of an assessment.

#### Robots.txt
- Instructs web crawlers which resources can and cannot be accessed for indexing.
- can provide valuable information such as the location of private files and admin pages.

#### Source Code
- Inspect the source code for credential leaks or  links to hidden directories.
