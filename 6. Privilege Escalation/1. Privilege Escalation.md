## PrivEsc Checklists

- One excellent resource is [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), which has an excellent checklist for both [Linux](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/linux-hardening/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist.html) and [Windows](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/windows-hardening/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation.html) local privilege escalation.
- Another excellent repository is [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), which also has checklists for both [Linux](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md).


## Enumeration Scripts

- Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS).
- Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)

## Kernel Exploits

- Look for kernel exploits whenever we encounter an old operating system.
- Google for exploits for that specific os version.

## Vulnerable Software

- Look for vulnerable software in the installed software.
- `dpkg -l ` command on Linux to see installed software
- `C:\Program Files` on windows contain all the installed software for windows.

## User Privileges

- Suppose we are able to run specific commands as root, we may be able to escalate our privileges to root/system.
- Common ways to exploit user privileges : 
		1. Sudo
		2. SUID
		3. Windows Token Privileges
- We can check sudo privileges we have with the `sudo -l `command.
**Eg**

- In certain scenario's when we run the `sudo -l` command, we will be able to see certain commands that a user is able to run as root with "`NOPASSWD`".
- We can run those commands without a password.
- In that scenario we can use the `sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!`.

- Once we find a particular application that we can run with sudo, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user.
-  [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through `sudo`. We can search for the application we have `sudo` privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the `sudo` privilege we have.
