## PrivEsc Checklists

- One excellent resource is [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), which has an excellent checklist for both [Linux](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/linux-hardening/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist.html) and [Windows](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/windows-hardening/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation.html) local privilege escalation.
- Another excellent repository is [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), which also has checklists for both [Linux](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md).


## Enumeration Scripts

- Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS).
- Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)

## Kernel Exploits

- Look for kernel exploits whenever we encounter an old operating system.
- Google for exploits for that specific os version.

## Vulnerable Software

- Look for vulnerable software in the installed software.
- `dpkg -l ` command on Linux to see installed software
- `C:\Program Files` on windows contain all the installed software for windows.

## User Privileges

- Suppose we are able to run specific commands as root, we may be able to escalate our privileges to root/system.
- Common ways to exploit user privileges : 
		1. Sudo
		2. SUID
		3. Windows Token Privileges
- We can check sudo privileges we have with the `sudo -l `command.
**Eg**
![[Pasted image 20251216085004.png]]

- In certain scenario's when we run the `sudo -l` command, we will be able to see certain commands that a user is able to run as root with "`NOPASSWD`".
- We can run those commands without a password.
- In that scenario we can use the `sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!`.

- Once we find a particular application that we can run with sudo, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user.
-  [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through `sudo`. We can search for the application we have `sudo` privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the `sudo` privilege we have.
- [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#) also contains a list of Windows applications which we may be able to leverage to perform certain functions, like downloading files or executing commands in the context of a privileged user.


# Scheduled Tasks

- Scheduled tasks (Windows)
- cron jobs (Linux)
- There are basically 2 ways we can take advantage of these : 
		1. Add new schedule tasks/ cron jobs.
		2. Trick them to execute a malicious software.
		
- `Checking if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks : `
		1. In Linux, check if we have write permissions over these directories : 
			1. `/etc/crontab`
			2. `/etc/cron.d`
			3. `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`

# Exposed Credentials

- Look for files (`config files, log files and user history files`) we can reed and see if then contain any exposed credentials.
- The [[#Enumeration Scripts]] usually look for these kinds of passwords will provide them to us.
- If passwords found : 
		1. Check password reuse : `su -`, then enter the password to see if we can get system access.
		2. Try SSHing into their server as that user.
