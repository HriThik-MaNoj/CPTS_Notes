### Banner Grabbing

- Useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly.

##### Banner Grabbing using Nmap

```
nmap -sV --script=banner <target>
````

```
nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24
```
##### Banner Grabbing using Netcat

```
nc -nv <target> <port>
```


### FTP

- File Transfer Protocol
- Supports common commands such as cd and ls and allows us to download files using the get command.
##### Command to connect to the ftp service

```
ftp -p <target>
```

##### Command to download a file

``` 
get <filename>
```

### SMB

- Server Message Block
- Prevalent protocol on windows that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement.
- Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be  vulnerable to RCE exploits such as Eternal Blue.

##### Nmap script for enumerating SMB

```
nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40
```

#### Shares

- SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords.
##### smbclient (used for enumerating and interacting with SMB shares)

```shell-session
smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253
```
 -  -L flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host
 - -N suppresses the password prompt.
- This reveals the non-default share users.

##### Connect to smb as a guest user

```shell-session
smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
```

- Then check if we've got access by entering a command like "ls", we'll get an access denied message indicating that guest access is not permitted.

##### Connecting to SMB using credentials

```shell-session
smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users
```

- Then enter the password when prompted.
- After getting access, we can use the standard commands like cd and ls to navigate the system.
- get command can be used to download files.


### SNMP

- Simple Network Management Protocol
- SNMP community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device.
- SNMP versions 1 and 2c didn't support encryption or authentication, they were added in version 3 only.
-
