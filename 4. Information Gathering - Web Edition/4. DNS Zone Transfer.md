- A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers.

- This is mostly remediated, but if it's vulnerable to DNS zone transfer, we can exploit it by using dig : 
```bash
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```
