- Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mapping our terminal TTY with the remote TTY.

#### python/stty method
- In our netcat shell, we'll use the following command to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY:

**Syntax: 
```shell-session
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
- After we run this command, we'll hit `ctrl+z` to background our shell and get back to our local terminal, and input the following stty command : 

**Syntax**
```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echo
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ fg

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$
```

- At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else.

##### Correct terminal size

```
echo $TERM
- This will give us the term variable
- Next run: 
stty size
- This shows the values for rows and columns

export Term=<output we got for the first command>
stty rows <rows> columns <columns>
```
