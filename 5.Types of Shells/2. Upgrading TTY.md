# Upgrading TTY

When connecting via Netcat, basic shells are limited (no line editing/history). Upgrade to a fully interactive TTY.

## Python/pty + stty method
In the Netcat shell:
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
Background the shell, fix local tty, and foreground it:
```bash
# In your local terminal
Ctrl+z
stty raw -echo
fg

# press Enter twice
```
You should now have a fully interactive TTY.

## Correct terminal size
```bash
echo $TERM     # get current terminal type
stty size      # shows rows and columns

export TERM=xterm-256color  # or the value from echo $TERM
stty rows <rows> columns <columns>
```
