#### LaZagne

LaZagne is made up of `modules` which each target different software when looking for passwords. Some of the common modules are described in the table below:

|Module|Description|
|---|---|
|browsers|Extracts passwords from various browsers including Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera|
|chats|Extracts passwords from various chat applications including Skype|
|mails|Searches through mailboxes for passwords including Outlook and Thunderbird|
|memory|Dumps passwords from memory, targeting KeePass and LSASS|
|sysadmin|Extracts passwords from the configuration files of various sysadmin tools like OpenVPN and WinSCP|
|windows|Extracts Windows-specific credentials targeting LSA secrets, Credential Manager, and more|
|wifi|Dumps WiFi credentials|
> many tools for decrypting the various credentials databases used can be found online, such as [firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) and [decrypt-chrome-passwords](https://github.com/ohyicong/decrypt-chrome-passwords). LaZagne supports `35` different browsers on Windows.

If we are using `xfreerdp` all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.

Once `LaZagne.exe` is on the target, we can open command prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the directory the file was uploaded to, and execute the following command:

```cmd-session
C:\Users\bob\Desktop> start LaZagne.exe all
```

#### findstr

We can also use [findstr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr) to search from patterns across many types of files.

```cmd-session
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

- Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
- Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
- Password in scripts on IT shares
- Passwords in `web.config` files on dev machines and IT shares
- Password in `unattend.xml`
- Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
- KeePass databases (if we are able to guess or crack the master password)
- Found on user systems and shares
- Files with names like `pass.txt`, `passwords.docx`, `passwords.xlsx` found on user systems, shares, and [Sharepoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)
