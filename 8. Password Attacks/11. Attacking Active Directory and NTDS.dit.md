#### Custom username generation

- We can google the company's name and find a list of employees who work in that company
- Then we can use [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats.
```shell-session
./username-anarchy -i /home/ltnbob/names.txt 
```
