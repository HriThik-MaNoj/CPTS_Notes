-  [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to scan potential words from a company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules to create a customized password list—one that has a higher probability of containing the correct password for an employee.
- specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (`-d`), the minimum length of the word (`-m`), the storage of the found words in lowercase (`--lowercase`), as well as the file where we want to store the results (`-w`).
```shell-session
cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
```
