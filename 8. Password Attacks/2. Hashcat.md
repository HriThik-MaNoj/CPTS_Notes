## General syntax

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hashes> [wordlist,rle, mask, ...]
```

- `-a` : specifies attack mode
- `-m`: specifies hash type
- `<hashes>` : can be a hash string or a file containing one or more `password hashes of the same type`.
- - `[wordlist, rule, mask, ...]` is a placeholder for additional arguments that depend on the attack mode

## Attack modes
- **Modes** : `dictionary`, `mask`, `combinator` and `association`.
- Imagine that we got a password hash from a compromised sql database. our method to crack will be as follows:
- what is the hash type? identify it first
- find the corresponding hash id for hashcat
- Then we need to decide an attack mode
syntax:

```
hashcat -a 0 (0 specifies dictionary mode) -m 0 (0 specifies md5 in hashcat) <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Rule based attack

```shell-session
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

# Show the cracked passwd

```
hashcat -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show
```
## Mask attack

[Mask attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack) (`-a 3`) is a type of brute-force attack in which the keyspace is explicitly defined by the user. For example, if we know that a password is eight characters long, rather than attempting every possible combination, we might define a mask that tests combinations of six letters followed by two numbers.

A mask is defined by combining a sequence of symbols, each representing a built-in or custom character set. Hashcat includes several built-in character sets:

|Symbol|Charset|
|---|---|
|?l|abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz|
|?u|ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|
|?d|0123456789|
|?h|0123456789abcdef|
|?H|0123456789ABCDEF|
|?s|«space»!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|
|?a|?l?u?d?s|
|?b|0x00 - 0xff|

- Let's say that we specifically want to try passwords which start with an uppercase letter, continue with four lowercase letters, a digit, and then a symbol. The resulting hashcat mask would be `?u?l?l?l?l?d?s`.
```shell-session
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 1e293d6912d074c0fd15844d803400dd '?u?l?l?l?l?d?s'
```
