## Single crack mode
- generates password candidates based on victim's username, home directory name, and [GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field) values.
```shell-session
john --single passwd
```

## Wordlist mode
- Uses dictionary attack.
```shell-session
john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> <hash_file>
```

## Incremental mode
- It is designed to test all character combinations defined by a specific character set, prioritizing more likely passwords based on training data.
```shell-session
john --incremental <hash_file>
```

- [hashID](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID) can identify hash types.
