#### MSF - Specific Search

```shell-session
msf6 > search type:exploit platform:windows cve:2021 rank:excellent microsoft
```
- `info` : select a module  and then use info command to get more info on that module.

#### MSF - Permanent Target Specification

- basically just add a `g` at the end.. setg lhost... setg rhosts and so on.
```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > setg RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
```

## Payloads
- Refers to a module that aids the exploit module in (typically) returning a shell to the attacker.
- Three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: `Singles, Stagers, and Stages`
- Whether or not a payload is staged is represented by `/` in the payload name.
- For example, `windows/shell_bind_tcp` is a single payload with no stage, whereas `windows/shell/bind_tcp` consists of a stager (`bind_tcp`) and a stage (`shell`).
- `Singles` are self-contained payloads. They are the sole object sent and executed on the target system, getting us a result immediately after running.
- `Stagers` are used to establish the network connection between our attack host and the target victim.small and reliable.
- `Stages`
