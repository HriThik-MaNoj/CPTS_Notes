## Overview

- **MIB** : Management Information Base is an independent format for storing device information.
- **OID** : represents a node in a hierarchy.


## Footprinting the Service

**SNMPwalk**
```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
#query the OIDs with their information
```

**OneSixtyOne**
```bash

HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install onesixtyone
$ onesixtyone -c /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt <ip-address>
```

**Braa**

- Once we know a community string, we can use it with [braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.
```bash
sudo apt install braa
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*
```
