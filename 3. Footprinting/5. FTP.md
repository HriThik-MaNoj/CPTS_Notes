File Transfer Protocol
- Runs within the application layer of TCP/IP protocol stack.
- Imagine that we wanna pload local files to a server and download other files using FTP
- In an FTP connection, two channels are opened :
		1. Client and server establish control channel through `TCP port 21`.
		2. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes.
		3. Then both parties can establish data channel via `TCP port 20`. ( this channel is used exclusively for data transmission)
- `Active FTP` : client establilshes the connection as described via port 21. However, if there's a firewall, server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked.
- `Passive FTP` : Here the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client is initiating the connection in this method.. the firewall doesn't block the transfer.

## TFTP
- simpler than FTP.
- does not provide user authentication and other features supported by FTP.
- FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses UDP

### Default Configuration
- One of the most common FTP servers is `vsFTPd`

### Anonymous login
- allows logging into FTP servers without requiring credentials.
##### Downloading all available files 
```shell-session
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```
