Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- Used for sending emails in an IP network.
- Accepts connection requests on port 25 by default
- To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server.
```shell-session
 telnet 10.129.14.128 25
```

**Telnet - VRFY**
- can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. (doesn't work always depending on how the SMTP server is configured.
```shell-session
HrithikManoj000@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
