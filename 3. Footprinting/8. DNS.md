Domain Name System
- Resolves host names/domains/computer names into IP addresses.
- Information is distributed across thousands of name servers.
There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:
- DNS root server
- Authoritative name server
- Non-authoritative name server
- Caching server
- Forwarding server
- Resolver

| DNS Record | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`        | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAAA`     | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `MX`       | Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `NS`       | Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TXT`      | This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| `CNAME`    | This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.               |
| `PTR`      | The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.                                                                                                                                     |
| `SOA`      | Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.                                                                                                                                            |

#### Footprinting the service

```shell-session
dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
```shell-session
dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85
```
```shell-session
dig any inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
```shell-session
dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
```shell-session
dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```

#### Subdomain Brute Forcing

```shell-session
for sub in $(cat /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done
```

###### DNS Enum
```shell-session
dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt inlanefreight.htb
```
