> Oracle Transparent Network Substrate

- Communication protocol that facilitates the communication between oracle databases and applications over networks.
- Default Listener port : `TCP/1521`
- Oracle 9 has a default password, `CHANGE_ON_INSTALL`
- Oracle DBSNMP service also uses a default password, `dbsnmp`
- Oracle Database Attacking Tool (`ODAT`) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases.

## Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open
```

- In Oracle RDBMS, a System Identifier (`SID`) is a unique name that identifies a particular database instance
- It can have multiple instances, each with its own System ID. An instance is a set of processes and memory structures that interact to manage the database's data.
## Nmap - SID Bruteforcing

```bash
sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open --script oracle-sid-brute
```

## ODAT

- We can use odat.py to perform a variety of scans to enumerate and gather information about the Oracle database services and it's components.

```bash
#using the all option to use all modules of the odat tool.
./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235
```

- If we get valid credentials using these methods, we can use `sqlplus` to connect to the Oracle database and interact with it.

## SQLplus - Login

``` bash
sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE
```
