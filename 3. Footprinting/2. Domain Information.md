# Domain Information

Not just about the subdomains but about the entire presence on the Internet. Gather information and try to understand the company's functionality and which technologies and structures are necessary for services to be offered successfully and efficiently.

## Certificate Transparency

A process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain.

### crt.sh

```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .
```

**Filtered by unique subdomains:**

```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=acsiatech.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```

## Company Hosted Servers

We can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.

```bash
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
```

## Shodan IP List

> **Note:** Requires Shodan API KEY

```bash
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
```

## DNS Records

Display all the available DNS records where we might find more hosts:

```bash
dig any inlanefreight.com
```

| Record | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `A` | Returns the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain |
| `MX` | Shows which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company |
| `NS` | Shows which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider |
| `TXT` | Often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376) |
