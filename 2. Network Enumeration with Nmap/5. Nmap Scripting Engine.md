Nmap Scripting Engine (`NSE`) is a handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services.

## Script Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `--script <category>` | Run specific category scripts |

Refer to [Nmap Scripting Engine](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/19/section/108) section from HTB academy for more details regarding the 14 categories of scripts.

## Aggressive Scan

The `-A` flag performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute and uses default scripts to scan the target.

```bash
sudo nmap -A 10.129.2.28
