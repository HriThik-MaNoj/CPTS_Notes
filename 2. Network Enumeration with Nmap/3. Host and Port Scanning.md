## Host and Port Scanning

-  After we find out that our target is alive, we want to get a more accurate picture of the system.
- This includes : 
		1. Open ports
		2. Service Versions
		3. Information that the services provided.
		4. Operating System
#### Different states of scanned ports
1. open : connection to scanned port has been established.
2. closed : Received back packet contains an `RST `flag.
3. filtered  : nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed.Either no response received or error code from the target.
4. unfiltered : Only occurs during `TCP-ACK` scan. port is accessible but cannot determine whether it's open or closed.
5. open | filtered : no response for a specific port, firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
6. closed | filtered : Occurs only during `IP ID idle` scans, indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered.

## Discovering Open TCP ports

- By default Nmap scans the top 1000 ports using the `TCP-SYN` scan (-sS), **`Only when we run it with root`**
- Else TCP connect scan is performed (-sT)

##### Nmap flag to scan top ports

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10 
```

### UDP Port Scan

- UDP is a stateless protocol, does not require a three-way handshake like TCP.
- No ackowledgement, higher timeout

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU
```
