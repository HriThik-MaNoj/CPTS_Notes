# Performance

We can use various options to tell `Nmap` how fast (`-T <0-5>`), with which frequency (`--min-parallelism <number>`), which timeouts (`--max-rtt-timeout <time>`) the test packets should have, how many packets should be sent simultaneously (`--min-rate <number>`), and with the number of retries (`--max-retries <number>`) for the scanned ports the targets should be scanned.

## Optimal RTT

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms` | Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout |
| `--max-rtt-timeout 100ms` | Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout |

## Timing Templates

In a blackbox environment, we cannot always manually optimise. Nmap offers six timing templates `-T <0-5>` for us to use:

| Template | Name |
|----------|------|
| `-T 0` | paranoid |
| `-T 1` | sneaky |
| `-T 2` | polite |
| `-T 3` | normal |
| `-T 4` | aggressive |
| `-T 5` | insane |
