# Saving the Results

Nmap provides several output formats to save scan results for later analysis.

---

## Output Formats

| Flag | Format | File Extension |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `-oN` | Normal output | `.nmap` |
| `-oG` | Grepable output | `.gnmap` |
| `-oX` | XML output | `.xml` |

## Style Sheets

With XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people.

To convert XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`:

```bash
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```
