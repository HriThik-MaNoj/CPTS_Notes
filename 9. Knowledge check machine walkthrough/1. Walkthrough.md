- Only http and ssh are open
- Let's enumerate further with nmap and see if we can find anything else

- seems like we have an `/admin `directory

- let's try using gobuster and see if we can find more directories.

- Went to the admin page and saw a login form
- tried the username admin and password admin.. and boom!
- logged in as admin

- After poking around a bit I found that in the theme's section, there is an option to edit themes, and seems like the themes are written in php, so why not edit the theme and put a php reverse shell in there.. that's exactly what I'm gonna do..

- And we got a connection back at our nc listener..!!

- Lets now try to upgrade the tty using python command, refer to [[2. Upgrading TTY]] : 
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Privilege Escalation
- now we need to escalate our privileges and get root..
```
sudo -l
#To know what the current user can run with root permission without root password.
```

- So we need to run the php command to get root
- After a bit of research I found this : 
![[Pasted image 20251218054057.png]]

- Got root!
![[Pasted image 20251218054142.png]]

- Now let's upgrade that shell as well and then go and get the root flag.

- Done!
